## Featured Projects

### 🏠 Homelab Infrastructure
Built a professional dual-router homelab demonstrating enterprise networking and security skills.

**Technologies:** pfSense firewall, Proxmox virtualization, Pi-hole DNS filtering, OpenWRT, static routing

**Key Achievements:**
- Implemented inter-network static routing between separate subnets (192.168.8.0/24 ↔ 192.168.1.0/24)
- Configured pfSense enterprise firewall with custom rule sets for network segmentation
- Deployed Pi-hole for network-wide DNS filtering and ad blocking
- Performed architectural analysis identifying Layer 2 bridging constraints with WiFi-only ISP
- Created comprehensive technical documentation including troubleshooting methodology and root cause analysis

**Skills Demonstrated:** Network architecture, firewall configuration, routing protocols, systems administration, technical documentation, problem-solving under constraints

## Hands-On Labs
Below are selected labs and projects demonstrating applied security skills:

- **Credential Dump Detection Lab** – Detected LSASS dump activity using Sysmon and Windows Event IDs  
- **Windows Event Log Analysis** – Investigated brute-force authentication attempts  
- **Suspicious Login Analysis** – Used Microsoft Sentinel and KQL for detection queries  
- **Threat Actor Simulation** – Simulated PowerShell backdoor activity and analyzed forensic artifacts  
- **Phishing Email Triage** – Investigated a phishing attempt using a SOC-style workflow
