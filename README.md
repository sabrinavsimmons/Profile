# Hi, I’m Sabrina V. Simmons

Cybersecurity and Computer Science student with a focus on defensive security, networking, and security operations. I build and maintain a hands-on home lab to simulate real-world attacks and defenses, analyze logs and network traffic, and strengthen detection and incident response skills.

## Areas of Focus
- Security operations (SOC fundamentals)
- Network security and firewall configuration
- Log analysis and threat detection
- Windows and Linux system monitoring
- Home lab design and troubleshooting
---

## 📜 Certifications
- **CompTIA Security+** (In Progress)  
- **CompTIA Network+** (In Progress)

## 🛠 Hands-On Labs
Here are some of my favorite labs and projects:  

- 📝 **Credential Dump Detection Lab** – Detected LSASS dump activity with Sysmon & Event IDs.  
- 🧠 **Windows Event Log Analysis** – Investigated brute-force login attempts.  
- 🌍 **Suspicious Login Analysis** – Used Azure Sentinel & KQL for detection queries.  
- 🛡 **Threat Actor Simulation** – Simulated PowerShell backdoor and analyzed forensic artifacts.  
- 📧 **Phishing Email Triage** – Investigated a phishing attempt like a SOC analyst.  

> 💡 *More labs brewing in the cauldron.*

🖧 **Networking Projects**

- **CYB-210 Network Design Project** — Consolidated two class-C networks in Cisco Packet Tracer, implemented RIP and static routing, configured DHCP and DNS services, and added NAT/PAT for inter-network connectivity.
